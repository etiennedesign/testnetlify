		<h1>WorkflowGen for iManage</h1>

		<h3>Add process automation and compliance to iManage Work</h3>

		<p>
			WorkflowGen’s integration possibilities allow it to be transparently and fluidly embedded into other popular platforms. A great example of this is Office Information Australia’s use of WorkflowGen embedded in its Document Approval process for iManage, a leading document and management system.
			<br/><br/>
			The solution eliminates paper forms, drastically reduces the number of emails involved in the workflow, keeps a detailed request history, lets users launch and track document approvals from anywhere on any device — all while maintaining the interface users are already familiar with.
		</p>

		<h3>Technical solutions</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				WorkflowGen User Portal embedded into iManage client interfaces (FileSite, DeskSite, WorkSite Web and SharePoint) lets users launch processes by simply right-clicking on the document.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bidirectional integration allows users to view the iManage document repository from within a workflow application, where they can search for documents and attach them to requests.
			</li>
			<li>
				Processes can be called directly from a URL to allow highly customized User Portal environments that can display specific WorkflowGen processes within lists of links.
			</li>
			<li>

			</li>
			<li>
				The Dashboard feature lets users track the status of their document approvals in real time at every stage of the process.

			</li>
			<li>
				Support for the creation and management of workspaces and custom metadata.
			</li>
			<li>
				Process forms and data can be converted to PDF and stored in the repository.
			</li>
		</ul>
