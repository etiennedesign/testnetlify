		<h1>How a large corporation streamlines hundreds of subsidiaries' legal authorizations</h1>

		<h3>An entire approval circuit based on a company directory</h3>

		<p>
			When managing hundreds of subsidiaries under the umbrella of one large corporation, keeping track of and controlling all required legal authorizations can cause real headaches. In this organization, these requests were being passed between different actors — on paper forms! Needless to say, this process was a hassle, inefficient, and not very secure. With no efficient way to properly manage and track requests, forms would easily get lost, or languish on someone’s desk while they were on vacation, creating bottlenecks and confusion.
			<br/><br/>
			To centralize and optimize this internal process, the solution needed to do the following:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Integrate with the company’s existing technological stack
			</li>
			<li>
				Provide automatic notifications
			</li>
			<li>
				Give assistants the ability to track every request
			</li>
			<li>
				Automatically determine each and every actor in an approval circuit based on specific conditions
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The WorkflowGen solution</h3>

		<p>
			By dynamically defining an entire approval circuit, legal authorizations could now follow a specific workflow without the risk of any of them getting lost. An assistant could easily launch an authorization request in a few minutes, with automatic notifications sent to all actors involved in the approval circuit. And, of course, paper forms would finally become a thing of the past.
			<br/><br/>
			WorkflowGen’s GETUSERSFROMDIR application retrieves specific users based on any condition, such as job title and company name, in order to automatically assign actions to individual users or to groups of users. This is a perfect example of how WorkflowGen can leverage an existing company directory through a tight integration that allows for the easy automation of tasks that might otherwise take hours, days, or even weeks. The most obvious benefits come in the form of time freed for higher value tasks, and increased security and integrity of the requests themselves, since they can no longer get lost or stuck.
		</p>

		<h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Company directory synchronized with the WorkflowGen database
			</li>
			<li>
				GETUSERSFROMDIR workflow application configured to retrieve users
			</li>
			<li>
				Actions assigned to the retrieved users
			</li>
			<li>
				End-user portal embedded into the company intranet
			</li>
			<li>
				Search function created for users to manually assign actions to specific users
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Benefits</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				The delegation tool gives users the ability to delegate an action or a selection of actions to another user. This feature keeps the workflow running without encountering any bottlenecks.
			</li>
			<li>
				Personalized notifications keep external actors informed of request statuses.
			</li>
			<li>
				WorkflowGen’s Quick Mass Approval and Remote Approval features together with the mobile app give process actors the tools to stay on top of decision-making.
			</li>
			<li>
				Assistants remain in control of legal authorizations and can intervene at any time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Automation of processes optimizes employees’ time by allowing them to work on strategic projects and value-added tasks.
			</li>
		</ul>
