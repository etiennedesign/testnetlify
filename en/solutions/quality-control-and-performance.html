		<h1>How a major manufacturer enhanced quality control and performance</h1>

		<h3>Plant and QA change control processes implemented in less than two months</h3>

		<p>
			
			
			A major manufacturer decided to migrate to a specialized workflow product to provide enhanced quality control and performance. They eventually chose WorkflowGen by Advantys, which is distributed in the Asia Pacific region by <a href="https://www.officeinfo.com.au/" target="_blank">Office Information Australia (OIA)</a>.
			<br/><br/>
			For many years, the company used a forms-driven approach to workflows to manage plant and QA change control within manufacturing processes. These forms were static in nature, on top of their Lotus Notes email environment.
			<br/><br/>
			They needed to be able to generate analytics and reporting in a real-time sense to assist their change control and associated production processes. They also needed a system that could be fully maintained in-house by their team and provide the flexibility to perform changes swiftly.
			<br/><br/>
			Training and delivery were completed over the course of a month and workflows were built by the companyâ€™s team in around two months.
			<br/><br/>
			They were pleasantly surprised with the ease of training and delivery, since they were now able to create workflows involving human and system actions within a few days.
