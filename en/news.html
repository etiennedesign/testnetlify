	<h2 class="center">Preserving financial independence and expertise in the IT industry:<br />a genuine advantage</h2>
	<h4 class="center">11.23.15</h4>
	<p>In the ultra-competitive market of new technologies, capitalistic movements strongly influence enterprises’ development strategies and often lead to mergers and acquisitions, whether profitable or not.</p>
	<p>Against this backdrop, it’s clear that the document management sector (BPM, EDM, ECM) is experiencing profound changes that translate into merger and acquisition operations. Even though some of these seem to bear fruit, a good number of them have as their goal to kill competitors and snatch up their client. The notion of the business plan is totally absent from these operations.
