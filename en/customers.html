		<p>“WorkflowGen is a staple system in our business processes. We adopted WorkflowGen in 2008 and it quickly proved to be very stable and reliable. The initial installation was performed by the vendor and we received training to develop forms and workflows. Maintenance of WorkflowGen has always been simple to perform and we have rarely resorted to customer support. We relied more on customer support during the initial development of forms and workflows which, due to the high level of customization, has been historically centralized within the IT Department. Our experience with Advantys’ customer support has consistently been great and they have always been responsive, knowledgeable, effective and courteous. Recently we upgraded to version 6 and we took this opportunity to review our internal process for creating forms and workflows. We now expect to further increase the use of WorkflowGen by empowering users with administrative requirements to create their own forms and workflows.”</p>

		<p>“WorkflowGen is a software tool precisely designed to take care of automating any business workflow process. Wherever there is a form and a process, WorkflowGen can be applied very quickly to convert a manual process into a systematic process. Besides WorkflowGen’s simple and straightforward method of handling form and flow, it makes interfacing to external resources, at any step of a flow, a snap. For Business Intelligence (BI) reporting, we can integrate steps to write customized log records, which will serve as a base for all BI reporting.”</p>

		<p>“We are very pleased with our decision to purchase WorkflowGen. We knew there must be a better way to process the thousands of paper work requests that we receive each year. We initially looked at having someone write a customized program which turned out to be well over our budget. We then looked at some of the larger workflow software companies and found that their software was expensive and required substantial programming to implement. Once we discovered WorkflowGen, we knew that we were looking at something special. Being able to design workflow processes using forms, without formal programming, was extremely important to us. Designing processes using WorkflowGen is relatively simple for an end-user to do with out formal programming. We plan to extend WorkflowGen processes to other areas since it is so easy to design and implement them quickly and economically. We are very satisfied with the product.”</p>

Thanks to the SDK, even our existing applications (e.g. ERP, Microsoft Exchange) can be connected without any problems.”</p>
