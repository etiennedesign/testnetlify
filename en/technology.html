			<h2>Deliver advanced process-driven solutions with a high level of configurability</h2>
			<p>WorkflowGen includes a powerful .NET workflow engine optimized to run complex processes while handling a high number of transactions. Its full-featured web-based Administration Module provides a fluid user experience to manage your processes. This allows you to focus on process configuration and integration points thanks to advanced workflow features available out-of-the-box, such as delegations, custom notifications, sub-processes, parallelization of activities through synchronizations, system actions (webhooks, web services, .NET Assemblies), process versioning, and advanced authorization management (requester, actor, supervisor, workflow data visibility).</p>

		<h2>GraphQL API, Webhooks &amp;  Node.js integration</h2>
		<p>With GraphQL, developers have control over data they want to manipulate and exchange with the WorkflowGen API. Whether for a mobile app, a web application or micro services, they have exactly the data they want with optimal performance. The WorkflowGen GraphQL API offers a new level of integration and customization by letting developers extend the GraphQL schema to add their own types, queries, and mutations. With great freedom and speed, developers can create original solutions with high added value by going beyond the traditional frameworks of workflows and BPM to accelerate digital transformation.</p>

	<div id="wfg-graphql"></div>

	<div class="text-center">
		<p>Incoming webhooks are modern and simple solutions to integrate WorkflowGen with external applications. Developers can create incoming webhooks to complete a workflow action or to create a new request, and more operations are available. They just need to post a JSON payload to a unique URL generated by WorkflowGen's new incoming webhook workflow application; no additional authentication is required.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>The GraphQL API and incoming webhooks are Node.js applications running as IIS applications and fully integrated with the WorkflowGen .NET infrastructure. This new hybrid approach with Node.js on top of the .NET workflow engine offers the best of both worlds: fast integration and customization with Node.js, along with high performance and mature BPM algorithms with .NET.</p>

		<h2>Scalable infrastructure</h2>
		<p>WorkflowGen supports web farm configurations, letting you set up two or more web servers to handle workflow requests. This type of configuration improves performance and provides high availability.<br/><br/>You can configure WorkflowGen to store file data in the database or in the file system. Database storage simplifies file data administration and allows for backups without interruption of service. File system storage provides the following benefits:</p><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>Optimization of database size and database server CPU load</li>
			<li>Reduction in network bandwidth usage between the web server and the database server</li>
			<li>Storage of file data in a local or remote folder</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
		<div id="wfg-high-scability"></div>
	<div class="text-center">
		<p>WorkflowGen offers several options to optimize storage size and response time according to your constraints. For example, you can reduce the amount of data displayed on the User Portal home page, or you can define process data to either store all versions of data values by action, or only the latest version.<br/><br/>WorkflowGen provides a unique way to dramatically improve process response time thanks to database farms. In addition to the “Master” WorkflowGen database, you can set up a read-only “Slave” database that replicates the Master database in near real time. In this configuration, WorkflowGen forwards read-only SQL queries to the Slave database, and since there are more “read” queries than “write” commands, product performance is dramatically improved. Database scaling is supported only with SQL Server databases.</p>

		<h2>Enterprise-grade form designer</h2>
		<p>With WorkflowGen's built-in web form designer, you can quickly create advanced forms with enterprise-grade features including gridview management, multilingual UIs, custom tools, and the unique interactive workflow view to visually define form behavior by action. Customization and integration possibilities are unleashed thanks to transparent ASP.NET web form generation and a built-in C# code-behind editor.</p>
